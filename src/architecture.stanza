Base Type for Power Converter Architectures

Derived types like Buck, Boost, etc, will implement
the interface of this type.

Circuit Generator for Converter Architecture

This function is generator and is expected to run in
a `pcb-module` context.

This function constructs the circuit architecture given
an interface to the IC that controls the converter architecture.

@param x This Converter
@param pt Port of Bundle Type that interfaces to the IC. This type
will typically be converter specific.
@return Output nodes of the converter as a mapping `name => port`. For
many architectures, there will be only one output. If the converter has
multiple outputs (like for a transformer isolated switching converter),
then the function can return uniquely named ports for each output.
The names are implementation specific but the port will be either a
module or component port.
